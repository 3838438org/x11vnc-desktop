## Entering Full-Screen Mode
After starting the Docker image, you can change your web browser to full-screen mode, so that the LXDE desktop environment would occupy the whole screen.

For the best cross-platform solution, we recommend *Google Chrome*. To enable the full-screen mode, go to the menu bar and select `View --> "Full Screen"` (or `Enter Full Screen`). Alternatively, open the Chrome menu (the three vertical dots at the top right) and select the square to the far right of the Zoom buttons (the "+" and "-" buttons). To exit the full-screen mode, press the F11 key on Windows or Linux, or press `Ctrl-Cmd-f` on Mac (hold down the `control` and `command` keys and press `f`).

Alternatively, you can also use the "native" browsers on different platforms.
- On Windows, you can use *Microsoft Edge*. Toggle on and off the full-screen mode by pressing Win+Shift+Enter (hold down the Windows and Shift keys and press Enter).
- On Mac, you can use *Safari*, for which you can toggle the full-screen mode by clicking on the green circle at the top-left corner of *Safari* or selecting the `View --> "Enter Full Screen"` menu. To exit the full-screen mode, press `Ctrl-Cmd-f`, or slide your mouse to the top of the display to enable the menus.
- On Linux, you could use the default browser *Firefox*. You can enter and exit full-screen mode for *Firefox* by clicking on the `Fullscreen` button in the left sidebar of the desktop. However, we do not recommend this approach, because *Firefox* would exit the full-screen mode whenever you press `Esc`, and various applications in the Docker image also use the `Esc` key. Instead, you can use *Google Chrome* or the *Chromium browser*, which have virtual the same user interface.

If the desktop started in a recommended browser, copy and paste the URL into a recommended browser.
