## Preparation
Before you start, you need to first install Python and Docker on your computer by following the steps below.

### Installing Python
If you use Linux or Mac, Python is most likely already installed on your computer, so you can skip this step.

If you use Windows, you need to install Python if you have not yet done so. The easiest way is to install `Miniconda`, which you can download at https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe. You can use the default options during installation.

### Installing Docker
Download the Docker Community Edition for free at https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download and then run the installer. Note that you need administrator's privilege to install Docker. After installation, make sure you launch Docker before proceeding to the next step.

**Notes for Windows Users**
1. Docker only supports 64-bit Windows 10 Pro or higher. If you have Windows 8 or Windows 10 Home, you need to upgrade your Windows operating system before installing Docker. Stony Brook students can get Windows 10 Education free of charge at https://stonybrook.onthehub.com. Note that the older [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox) supports older versions of Windows, but it should not be used.
2. After installing Docker, you may need to restart your computer to enable virtualization.
3. When you use Docker for the first time, you must change its settings to make the C drive shared. To do this, right-click the Docker icon in the system tray, and then click on `Settings...`. Go to `Shared Drives` tab and check the C drive.

**Notes for Linux Users**
* After you install Docker, make sure you add yourself to the Docker group by running the command:
```
sudo adduser $USER docker
```
Then, log out and log back in before you can use Docker.
