## Tips and Tricks
1. By default, Docker uses two CPU cores and 2GB of memory on Mac and Windows. If you want to run large jobs, go to the `Advanced` tab in `Settings` (or `Preferences` for Mac) and increase the amount of memory dedicated to Docker.
2. When using the Docker image, the files under `$HOME/.config`, `$HOME/.ssh`, %%PROJECT%% `$HOME/shared` and any other
directory that you might have mounted explicitly are persistent. Any change to files in other directories will be lost when you stop the Docker image. `$HOME/.config` contains the configuration files of the desktop environment. `$HOME/shared` maps to the working directory on the host where you started the docker image.
3. The `$HOME/.ssh` directory in the Docker image maps to the `.ssh` directory on your host computer. This is particularly convenient for you to use your ssh-keys for authentications with git repositories on github.com or bitbucket.org. To use your ssh-keys, run the `ssh-add` in a terminal to add your keys to the ssh-agent.
4. You can copy and paste between the host and the Docker image through the `Clipboard` box in the left toolbar, which is synced automatically with the clipboard of the Docker image. To copy from the Docker image to the host, first, select the text in the Docker image, and then go to the `Clipboard` box to copy. To copy from host to the Docker image, first, paste the text into the `Clipboard` box, and then paste the text in the Docker image.
